I did this project as a challenge for myself to see if I could build a working game from scratch
without using any references or tutorials. It was a chance for me to practice object
oriented programming and GUIs, as well as a way to learn not to run straight to StackOverflow
every time i get stuck. This was a really fun project to tackle and I was very happy with 
the end results. I plan on adding an AI for the user to play against in the future so stay tuned!

## Project Overview

Clicking on a chess piece will select it and clicking on a location on the 
board will move the selected piece to that location if the move is allowed.
A player's turn is over after they have made a valid move.
The game is over when a player capture's the opponent's King.
