title: "Building Power Demand Prediction"
---

Office buildings have an important role in shaping electricity demand
in modern societies. Their energy demand patterns account in some countries
for up to 45 % of the primary energy consumption. Monitoring the energy consumption
of buildings and appliances using smart meters allows for a better understanding of 
specific energy needs and patterns, as well as enables locating peak demand times 
which can help decision-makers and planners to improve electricity consumption.


## Project Overview 

* Cleaned and restructured smart power meter time series data into 
a multi-index data frame. 

* Conducted an extensive EDA to locate trends in the power demand.

* Used hierarchical agglomerative clustering to cluster building 
floors based on similarities. 

* Calculated and compared the average annual electricity cost of
 the building in different countries.

* Trained a SARIMA model to predict daily power demand 
taking into account weekends and national holidays.
