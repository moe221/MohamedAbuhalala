      <description>Movies have a big impact on our lives. They can influence the way we see the world around us. Diversity on the big screen is extremely important since it allows a much wider audience to see what diversity looks like outside of their own communities and become more familiar and accepting of it.
This project was meant to put Hollywood under the lens and analyze gender and race representation in a selection of movies spanning from the 1920s to 2021 using deep learning.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made it a habit to always look back at my previous work experiences and think about how what I&amp;rsquo;m learning now could have helped me do my job better or automate some tasks. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning about Natural Language Processing, which involves transforming text data into a format that a machine learning algorithm can understand. After learning some of the basics of NLP I was eager to try out this concept on some data that I collected myself during my time as a construction manager.</description>

      <description>Office buildings have an important role in shaping electricity demand in modern societies. Their energy demand patterns account in some countries for up to 45 % of the primary energy consumption. Monitoring the energy consumption of buildings and appliances using smart meters allows for a better understanding of specific energy needs and patterns, as well as enables locating peak demand times which can help decision-makers and planners to improve electricity consumption.</description>

      <description>I did this project as a challenge for myself to see if I could build a working game from scratch without using any references or tutorials. It was a chance for me to practice object oriented programming and GUIs, as well as a way to learn not to run straight to StackOverflow every time i get stuck. This was a really fun project to tackle and I was very happy with the end results.</description>

      <description>looking for an apartment in berlin is so annoyingly hard and competitive that it feels like it should be an olympic sport. Everyone knows that finding the perfect apartment isn&amp;rsquo;t easy, but being well prepared by doing some research on the renting market in Berlin before jumping in and trying your luck, could improve your chances. Recently, I was thinking about moving myself and wanted to get an idea of what I should expect, so I decided to do this project to help me with my apartment hunt!</description>

      <title>Temperature-based Retention Time</title>

      <description>Most sewer networks consist of gravity pipes, which rely on the natural slope of the landscape to convey waste-water, and pressure pipes, which are driven by a pump that pushes waste-water to higher located collection points. Anaerobic retention time (ART) is defined as the amount of time a given volume of waste-water resides in a pressure pipe before being discharged. Long retention times have been linked to an increase in the occurrence of unwanted biological and chemical processes, such as the formation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) which is associated with odor, corrosion, and health problems.</description>
