During my childhood, I was obsessed with Legos.
The idea of creating something new out of a bunch of colorful little bricks
used to amaze me and I would spend hours, and sometimes even days,
planning and constructing my own little buildings,
bridges and of course, spaceships. That's why no one was surprised when
I decided to become a Civil Engineer!

After getting my degree in civil engineering, I discovered a new passion for
data and programming and have since made it my mission to continue learning by
staying up-to-date with the newest technologies and analytic techniques.

Recently, I completed a Data Science Bootcamp at Le wagon focusing on Python,
SQL and databases, Data processing, Data visualization, Statistics,
Machine Learning, Containerization, Google Cloud Platform, and cloud architecture.

Currently, I am seeking new opportunities as a data engineer where I can use my
new skills and continue to learn and improve.
